NAME:
    CompareRepos.py

DESCRIPTION:
    This python script (3.6+ compatible) will compare changelists in 2 repos
    It is a companion script to P4Transfer.py and reads the same source/target config file.

    Usage:

        python3 CompareRepos.py -h

    The script requires a config file as for P4Transfer.py
    The config file provides the Perforce connection information for both servers, 
    and source/target client workspace names.

    For full documentation/usage, see project doc:
